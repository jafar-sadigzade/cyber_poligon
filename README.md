**BUILDING A VIRTUAL CYBER POLYGON ENVIRONMENT**

In today's age, almost every day we come across new cyber attack methods and techniques. Although research is being conducted at the level of both the government and some cyber security companies to study and prevent these cyber attacks, it is difficult for other people in this field to engage in research in this field without a real work environment. For this reason, no matter how much cyber security is developing, cyber security science and research in this field lags far behind. In the article we have written, a new virtual cyber polygon environment has been built to increase scientific-practical research in the field of cyber security, as well as to make the results of the studies closer to reality, and suggestions have been made for the exploitation of this environment.
